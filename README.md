# MB_DCLogs
a simple logs system that uses an export that you can add in any client side of a script

for colors (https://gist.github.com/thomasbnt/b6f455e2c7d743b796917fa3c205f812)

exports['MB_DCLogs']:sahbesLog('NAME FOR THE BOT', 'YOUR TEXT THAT NEEDS TO BE LOGGED', COLOR, WEBHOOK ID)

everything is costumizable, it just requires basic lua knowledge
